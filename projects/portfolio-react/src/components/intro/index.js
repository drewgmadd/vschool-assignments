      <p class="about-text">Born and rased in Salt Lake City, UT, I have a passion for the mountains and outdoors that has only recently become rivaled by my passion for web development and the associated problem solving and learning process.  I began my coding journey just over four months ago having my full stack JavaScript certificate from Vschool in Salt Lake City.  I  am positive, hard-working and have a passion for learning and implementing various technologies.  Check out my progress on <a class="about-link" href="https://github.com/drewgmadd">github!</a></p>
