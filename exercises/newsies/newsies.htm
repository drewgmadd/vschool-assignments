       Winter is near and the time has come to get out the rock boards and skis.
        With temperatures dropping and the mountains seeing a few dustings at
        higher altitudes, people are starting to get excited.  There are <span class="sales">
        multiple ski swaps and sales,</span> so if you are in need of new gear, now is the time.
        With last year producing the most snow for the Wasatch in recent years,
        people are hopeful that we will see a winter with at least as much snow
        as last year.  That being said, if snow falls too early, it can lead to
        very <span class="safety">dangerous backcountry conditions.</span>  Living in Salt Lake, we are all
        aware of the dangers of this.  However, there will always be the thrill
        seekers who will take unecesarry risks for a legendary run.

        I am hopeful for a good winter, plenty of snow and good times.  I hope
        everyone stays safe, leaves little trace, and has a good winter.
